		HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It structures web content using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists, allowing browsers to display information in a visually organized manner. HTML uses tags, typically enclosed in angle brackets, to define these elements. It forms the backbone of web pages, often combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. HTML is essential for web development, enabling developers to create user-friendly and accessible websites.
